    <p>Florida is not typically known for rock climbing and while there are fantastic indoor gyms spread across the sunshine state there is something special about getting outdoors and crimping real rock! Nestled in the Vortex area of the Santos mountain bike trail system are untapped rock climbing routes waiting for you to test your skills. If you are new to rock climbing, let us show you the ropes! Come join us!</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Leave no trace. Don't leave trash and pack out trash that others have left.  Keep the area beautiful for others to enjoy.</li>
      <li>No bolting. The rock in Santos Trail System is limestone. It is not condusive to bolting and you run the risk of splitting/weakening the rock, and having your bolt pull out if someone falls on it. Set up top rock anchor systems only. Generally there are trees accessible for this purpose.</li>
      <li>Don't climb above your skill level and take all factors into consideration including weather conditions, rock quality, gear condition and your own physical limits.</li>
      <li>Tell someone where you are going and when you expect to be back.</li>
      <li>Be nice. Respect fellow climbers and the environment. <strong>NOTE:</strong> This is also a shared use area with mountain bikers and equestrians. When hiking in and hiking out stay to the side and yield to others.</li>
